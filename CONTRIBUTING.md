## We use GitHub workflow

You can read more about workflow on GitHub [guides](http://guides.github.com/).

### How to contribute

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/verybigman/generator-bem/issues/new) with description or take from available.
2. Create a feature-branch with an issue number based on a master branch. For example, for an issue #42: `git checkout -b feature/issue@42`.
3. Commit changes and `push` your branch.
4. Create a pull-request from your feature branch.
5. Link your pull-request with an issue number by comment.
6. Wait for your pull-request and the issue to be closed.

_For pretty work with process you can use [git-extras](https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras) - very useful tool for Git_
